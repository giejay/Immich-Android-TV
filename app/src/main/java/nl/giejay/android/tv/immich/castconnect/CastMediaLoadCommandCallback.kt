/**
 * MediaLoadCommandCallback.onLoad() is invoked when the MediaManager detects the intent is a
 * load request, this method receives the load request's data and converts it to a video object.
 * Once converted, the video is played by the local player. The MediaManager is then updated
 * with the MediaLoadRequest and broadcasts the MediaStatus to the connected senders.
 *
 * The load request's data comes from the sender app, such as the mobile or web complimentary apps
 * and thus the data contract should be already defined most likely would be sharing the same data
 * catalogue. The load request data is a media info object and as long as that object is populated
 * with the right fields, this receiver part would remain the same. What varies is the actual data
 * values in the MediaInfo fields.
